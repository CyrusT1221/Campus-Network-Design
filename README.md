**Campus Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer**

**Description:**

This repository contains the documentation and configuration files for a comprehensive campus network design implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project was completed as part of a networking assignment, focusing on creating a scalable, efficient, and secure network infrastructure to meet the requirements of a fictional campus environment.

**Key Features:**

1. **Network Topology Design:**
- Utilized VLAN segmentation for logical separation of departments.
- Implemented inter-VLAN routing for seamless communication between departments.
- Configured trunking to connect switches and routers effectively.
  
2. **Router Configuration:**
- Central router setup to control LAN traffic and connect to the internet.
- Sub-interface configuration for each department's VLANs.
- Static routing to establish connectivity between the campus network and the ISP network.

3. **Switch Configuration:**
- Individual switch configurations for each department with unique IP addresses.
- VLAN setup on switches to isolate departments and enhance security.
- Trunk switch configuration to facilitate inter-VLAN communication.
  
4. **Workstations and Servers Setup:**
- Assignment of IP addresses and default gateways to workstations in each department.
- Installation and configuration of HTTP, DNS, and FTP services on a central server.
- Establishment of web server, DNS server, and FTP server functionalities.

5. **Security Mechanisms:**
- Implementation of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) for network security.
- Utilization of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS).
- Integration of Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to actively prevent and block intrusions.
  
**Lessons Learned:**

1. Importance of thorough planning and documentation before network configuration.
2. Understanding connectivity requirements and utilizing VLANs for segmentation.
3. Effective communication and distribution of responsibilities within the group.

**Key Components:**

1. **Assignment.pkt File**:
- Downloadable Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the entire network topology and configurations.
- Explore the network setup interactively and simulate different scenarios.
  
2. **Documentation** (Report+Slides):
- Detailed report file outlining the design considerations, configuration steps, and lessons learned during the project.
- Presentation slides summarizing the key aspects of the network design for quick reference.

**Usage:**
1. Download the assignment.pkt file to explore the network topology and configurations in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Refer to the documentation files for in-depth insights into the design process, configuration steps, and security mechanisms employed.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for educational purposes and as a reference for network design and configuration best practices. We hope you find it helpful and informative!
